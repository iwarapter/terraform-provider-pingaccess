# Upgrading to 0.4.x

## Highlights

* Support for PingAccess 6.x, whilst this should still work with PingAccess 5.x support for this is not guaranteed.
* **New Data Source:** `pingaccess_acme_default`
* **New Resource:** `pingaccess_acme_server`
* **New Resource:** `pingaccess_hsm_provider`
* resource/websession: Added support for `same_site` attribute.
* resource/keypair: Added `hsm_provider_id` attribute.

## Upgrade Notes

Several resources have deprecated attributes which should now be removed:

 - `pingaccess_site_authenticator`
    - `hidden_fields` attribute has been deprecated and functionality replaced automatically. This can be safely removed.
 - `pingaccess_rule`
    - `ignrored_configuration_fields` attribute has been deprecated and functionality replaced automatically. This can be safely removed.
