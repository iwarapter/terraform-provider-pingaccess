## Upgrade Notes

### Breaking Changes:

- `pingaccess_pingfederate_runtime`

The original resource has essentially been split-up into the following resources: [`pingaccess_pingfederate_runtime`][1] and [`pingaccess_pingfederate_admin`][2]

### Deprecations

Several resources have deprecated attributes which should now be removed:

 - `pingaccess_site_authenticator`
    - `hidden_fields` attribute has been deprecated and functionality replaced automatically. This can be safely removed.
 - `pingaccess_rule`
    - `ignrored_configuration_fields` attribute has been deprecated and functionality replaced automatically. This can be safely removed.
